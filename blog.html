<p>Two weeks ago, the GIT workshop was conducted by the Open-Source Open Community (OSOC) Club of the National Institute of Technology Tiruchirapalli. The Workshop was hosted by our senior Bhushan Mendhe and under the supervision of the staff advisor of the club Dr. (Mrs.) B. Janet.</p>

<p style="float: right;">The workshop was attended by the 1st year batch of MCA (batch 2025). Among them were many (like me) who were taught GIT for the first time. Enough assistance was ensured by the club members. All the club members were very active to answer any doubts raised by their juniors. The Club members included Virendra Singh, Ankur Bohra, Nilanjana Thakur, and Dheeraj Lakhotra among many others.</p>
<p>The workshop was a great experience for the junior batch as well. The junior batch was very impressed by the workshop. Even the new beginners found the workshop to be very informative and useful for the future. </p>

<p>Apart from other reasons what stood out was the efforts made by the club for their future inductees, unlike any other club that has started its induction process so far. This was a common thought in every attendee’s mind. They were also very impressed by the conduct of the club members toward their juniors. This was one (among many) reason why the junior batch was interested to get inducted into a club like this. </p>
<p>The junior batch was also given tasks and a set of questions based on what they learned in the session and a huge number of responses was noticed. Even during the task submission, when a participant faced any kind of difficulty was free to consult any of the senior members of the club which made the learning process even simpler and enjoyable. </p>
<p>But yes, nothing in this world has been perfect so there were a few limitations that we faced during the workshop. As many attendees mentioned the voice of our host Bhushan was not clearly audible at the last benches. Although they were made to sit in the front the class cannot accommodate over a hundred and ten students in the first few benches.  Had the mic working properly there wouldn’t be any such problem. But who can we blame for such a technical glitch?</p>
